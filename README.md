## Setup environment
Install docker for your system from here - https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

Launch Docker, and run in the root directory of the project:
```
docker-compose up
```

If you want to run containers in the detach mode (e.g. hidden), run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

To get access to the database shell instance in the container, in the separate terminal run:
```
docker exec -it docker-php-nginx-setup_mysql_1 bash
```

Login to mysql account from the bash:
```
mysql -u custom_db_user -p1111
```

Now your are able to perform MySQL commands, such as show databases:
```
show databases;
```

To quit from the mysql shell, run:
```
quit
```

To quit from the container, run:
```
exit
```
